## Objectives
With the increasing population of Purdue and the lack of housing, we decided to make a web application that makes housing searches easier than having to visit every single website out there. The main issue with the current housing search process is that it is too time-consuming, disorganized and inconvenient. The goal of this project is to make the housing search easier and more straightforward. To differentiate ourselves from existing and similar services, we will implement an intuitive design and provide a roommate compatibility feature that users can utilize to find potential roommates.

The overall objective of this project is to make a web application that makes the lives of those who are looking for a place to rent more convenient. At this point in time, there is not an updated application or website that includes all the student living choices near campus. Our goal is to make a simple user-friendly web application that includes the necessary information of the housing options near Purdue to make the student house-hunting experience less stressful.
